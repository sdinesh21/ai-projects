# AI-Projects

Welcome to the AI-Projects repository! This is a collection of innovative projects that utilize cutting-edge AI technologies, including Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Langchain, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our aim is to provide a hands-on learning experience for those interested in exploring the capabilities of AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing) and to foster a community of enthusiasts and developers working together to push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Introduction

This repository is designed as a starting point for those interested in AI technologies, specifically focusing on GPT, Langchain, and RAG. Each directory contains sample projects that demonstrate the capabilities and potential applications of these technologies.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into different directories with different use cases.

Each directory includes a README file with detailed descriptions of the projects, including their objectives, how to run them, and any necessary setup instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to have a basic understanding of programming and AI concepts. Some projects may require specific software or hardware requirements, which are listed in the individual project READMEs.
Here's how to clone this repository and set up your environment:

'bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Projects.git
cd AI-Projects'

Follow specific setup instructions for each project
