# AI-Projects

Welcome to the AI-Projects repository! This is a collection of innovative projects that utilize cutting-edge AI technologies, including Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Langchain, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our aim is to provide a hands-on learning experience for those interested in exploring the capabilities of AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing) and to foster a community of enthusiasts and developers working together to push the boundaries of what's possible.
